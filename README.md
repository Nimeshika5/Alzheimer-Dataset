# Alzheimer's Disease Detection Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains MRI scans of individuals categorized into three classes based on their cognitive status: Mildly Demented, Moderate Demented, and Non-Demented. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is utilized for research purposes in Alzheimer's disease detection.

## Classes

1. **Mildly Demented**: Individuals in this category show early signs of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Symptoms may include mild memory loss, difficulty solving problems, and communication issues. However, these symptoms do not significantly impair daily functioning.

2. **Moderate Demented**: Individuals at this stage exhibit more pronounced cognitive decline and functional impairment. Symptoms include worsening memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and difficulties with daily activities such as dressing and eating. Behavioral changes and increased dependency on others are common.

3. **Non-Demented**: Individuals in this category do not display significant cognitive impairment or symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease. They may have normal cognitive function for their age and do not meet the criteria for dementia or Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset consists of the following files:

- **Without GAN**: Folder containing data processed without the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
  - **test.zip**: Testing data for Alzheimer's disease detection.
  - **train.zip**: Training data for Alzheimer's disease detection.

- **With GAN**: Folder containing data processed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for augmentation or enhancement.
  - **test.zip**: Testing data augmented or enhanced using GANs.
  - **train.zip**: Training data augmented or enhanced using GANs.

## Usage

Researchers and developers can use this dataset for various purposes, including but not limited to:
- Alzheimer's disease detection research.
- Developing machine learning models for classification tasks.
- Studying the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
