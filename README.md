# Project Name

## Description

Brief overview of the project and its purpose.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Alzheimer's disease detection dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains MRI scans classified into three classes: Non Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.

### Folders

#### 1. Without GAN

This folder contains data processed without the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It includes the following zipped folders:

- **test.zip**: This zip file contains the testing data for the Alzheimer's disease detection task.

- **train.zip**: This zip file contains the training data for the Alzheimer's disease detection task.

#### 2. With GAN

This folder contains data processed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for augmentation or enhancement. It includes the following zipped folders:

- **test.zip**: This zip file contains the testing data augmented or enhanced using GANs.

- **train.zip**: This zip file contains the training data augmented or enhanced using GANs.

In the descriptions, it's important to specify the purpose of each folder and the contents of the zipped folders within them. This helps users understand the organization of your dataset and how to access the relevant data for their tasks. Adjust the description as needed based on any additional information about your dataset or processing methods.
